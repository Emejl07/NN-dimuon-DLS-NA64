# NN-dimuon-DLS-NA64

This repository contains the code and data for my master's thesis, which studies scalar dark matter at NA64. The research includes both traditional selection of events and neural network (NN) trained models to analyze the data.

## Overview

The NA64 experiment aims to search for dark matter and other new physics phenomena using a high-energy electron beam. This thesis focuses on the investigation of scalar dark matter particles produced in the NA64 experiment.

### Key Components

- **Traditional Event Selection**: Implements classical methods to select events that are consistent with the expected signature of scalar dark matter particles.
- **Neural Network Models**: Utilizes machine learning techniques to train models that can identify potential scalar dark matter events with higher accuracy and efficiency.
