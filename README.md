# Scalar Dark Matter Study at NA64

Welcome to the repository for the Master's thesis project focused on studying scalar dark matter at the NA64 experiment. This research project incorporates both traditional event selection techniques and state-of-the-art neural network (NN) models to analyze experimental data and gain insights into scalar dark matter interactions.

## About NA64

NA64 is a particle physics experiment located at CERN designed to explore the existence of new, weakly interacting particles such as dark matter. By using high-energy electron beams, NA64 aims to probe the existence of hidden sector particles that interact very weakly with ordinary matter.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and resources used for analyzing data related to scalar dark matter interactions at NA64. The project involves:

- **Traditional Event Selection:** Implementing established techniques for selecting relevant events from experimental data. These methods are crucial for identifying potential signals of scalar dark matter interactions amidst background noise.

- **Neural Network Models:** Developing and training neural network models to enhance event selection and improve the sensitivity of the analysis. Neural networks offer a powerful tool for pattern recognition and can significantly augment the capabilities of traditional analysis methods.
